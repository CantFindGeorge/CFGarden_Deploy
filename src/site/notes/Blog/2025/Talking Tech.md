# This Site's Setup

## Why This Site?

I started testing out Obsidian when I was making some short form content in 2022/23. However, I realized I much prefer to be the "man behind the curtain" and not the "Wizard of Oz". 

Since it's the site's inception I've made quite a few changes in my priorities and what information I plan to write about here. First and foremost is the #Blog. This originally wasn't part of the site but the more I thought about organization and spotlighting new content this seemed to be the best way forward. 

I also will be adding various pages with breakdowns on other topics like #Tech, #TCGs, #DnD5e, and other #Resources I personally use. I hope you find something useful here and enjoy the site.

## Techstack
I made this site using [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) and the [Digital Garden Plugin](https://dg-docs.ole.dev/). I had some issues using Vercel so I deployed it using [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/). 

I also set up a secondary repository on [Github](https://github.com/) that is just the files in this vault so easily make changes on any of my machines.
