# Decklists
## Current Rotation
I like to switch up what I'm playing quite a bit to keep things fresh and interesting. Below is a list of the current decks I've been enjoying.
- [Death by 1000 Acorns](https://moxfield.com/decks/n8UZXdaD3kGXjPa2zpFDDQ) - Golgari Squirrel Tribal
- [Day & Night](https://moxfield.com/decks/M-lUJSEutUav1_ueG8Pyjg) - Gruul Werewolf Tribal


## To Build
Truthfully my favorite part of any TCG is the deck brewing and idea cooking process. Below are some concepts I'm thinking about putting together eventually.
- [Birbs](https://moxfield.com/decks/QlvCby1bK0SMRsvB51t8Ag) - Bant Chocobo Bird Tribal
- Grixis Missy / Cyberman
- Mono-Red Dragons & Kobolds
- Boros Blink Assassins Creed
- Golgari Food Tokens
- Selesnya Rabbits
- Shadow Wizard Money Gang - Rakdos Wizard Burn

# Deck Building
## Packages
To make life easier so I don't have to recall every card name nor do I have to hunt it back down I've created the following packages on moxfield:
- [List of all Mana Rocks](https://managathering.com/manarocks.html)
- [Fetch Lands](https://moxfield.com/decks/U_T8Spd8FkaN95gGBsh8MQ)
- [Utility Lands](https://moxfield.com/decks/MOkI3BCUzEmtryC1raosbw)
- Mana Bases
	- [Boros Mana Base](https://moxfield.com/decks/7SHcCEUsA0CS9HtPW7p7rQ)
	- [Golgari Mana Base](https://moxfield.com/decks/nrLye5njSEGoRdFDX_YIUA)
	- [Rakdos Mana Base](https://moxfield.com/decks/_L-k1OF5dkW9CC9ZP2RT5A)
	- [Selesnya Mana Base](https://moxfield.com/decks/QWrGCHV5rkO_2Od6CGDNUA)
## Commander Deck Template
I personally subscribe to the following template from the [Command Zone Podcast, Episode 658](https://youtu.be/OSNV6224cHg?si=lmpy2Doo6s1lE8aU). I've had a lot of success using this formula as a jumping off point and then adding/cutting elements after [goldfishing](https://www.reddit.com/r/EDH/comments/aum2jo/lets_talk_about_goldfishing/) a bunch. 
I think the key to this method is finding cards that fall into one or more of the categories which opens up additional space for tech cards and personal flair.
