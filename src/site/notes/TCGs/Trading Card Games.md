I'm a **HUGE** fan of Trading Card Games, I've been playing #TCGs for over 2 decades and have been around the block more than once. I've competed in multiple local and regional level tournaments in my younger years.

# TCG Philosophy 
Regardless of what TCG I'm playing I always approach the game in the same way. Find some random card that has a cool vibe, effect, or art and build a fun deck around it. When I was younger I used to only play the latest meta cookie-cutter. However, I genuinely enjoy matches more I'm playing to have fun instead of playing to win.
