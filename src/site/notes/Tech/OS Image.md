# Creating a Custom Disk Image
In my oppion it's best practice to make a custom image of your disk after configuring your system. This way the next time you want to reformat, you can just flash the system with your disk image to restore to a brand new state with your customization in tact.

There are plenty of freeware programs that can do this, such as:
- [EaseUS Todo Backup](https://www.easeus.com/backup-software/tb-free.html)
