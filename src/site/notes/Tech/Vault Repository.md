# Purpose
I wanted to find an easy and free way to sync my Obsidian vaults across my devices. I also like that it ended up using software I'm already using for other #Projects.

> - [Github](https://github.com/)

# Configuration
1. Create a Github Account
2. Create a reposirty in the **Web Interface** of Github

From here we have a couple of options on how to sync the data with Github. 
1. Github Desktop App
	- Just download the desktop client
	- Clone the repo we created above to your machine
	- You can now push and pull updates through the GUI
2. Obsidian Github Plugin
	- You can install this plugin to obsidian that will push/pull at the press of a single button
	- Enter your account and repo info and that's it
	- While this is nice, I tend to push updates from my devices at different rates so I would be concerned about merge conflicts
